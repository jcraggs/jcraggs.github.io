								<h2>Background</h2>
								<p> I am currently a software engineer at Digital Applications International (DAI) in Stockport, a role which I have been in since January 2020. I spend my time testing, fixing bugs and implementing features for the two flagship web applications (written in Ember.js), which are used in large scale warehouse management systems. 
									Prior to this role I spent just over 3 years as an Environmental Engineer before making the decision in 2019 to focus on developing my programming abilities and begin my transition into the software development industry. I achieved this transition through a mixture of self-teaching as well as attending the Northcoders software developer training course in Manchester (Sep - Dec 2019).

								<h2>Interests</h2>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/nautilusmodel.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Outside of coding I enjoy travelling, fishing, and video/board games with friends. I also enjoy 3D design and printing. The image to the right shows the 3D model of a clock face I designed and printed. It's based on a nautilus shell and was later coated in carbon paint and electroplated with copper and nickel to give it a matte black and silver coloured metalic finish.</p>
